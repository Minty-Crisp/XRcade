If you have made it this far, let me just say Thank You! AUXL has been a dream of mine and a labor of love. I still have so much more to accomplish and it will far easier if I can get others to test, play with, contribute, donate or just offer words of encouragement to keep going. This all wouldn't be possible without the open source work of so many others as well especially the teams that have made A-Frame and Three.js! If you are interested in discussing AUXL further, have any questions or even interested in collaborating with me please reach out to me. You can find all my contact info on my [website](https://mintycrisp.com) or even my Github profile here. Thank You ^_^
